Version 3.0.7 (in progress)
===========================

2015-07-07: wsfulton
	    SWIG no longer generates a wrapper for a class' constructor if that class has
            any base class with a private destructor. This is because your compiler should
            not allow a class to be instantiated if a base has a private destructor. Some
            compilers do, so if you need the old behaviour, use the "notabstract" feature, eg:

              %feature("notabstract") Derived;
              class Base {
                ~Base() {}
              };
              struct Derived : Base {};
